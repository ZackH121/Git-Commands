set of cards laid out in an n(row) by m(column) grid
Some are face up, and others are face down


Four Types of Flips:
-Top Flip
-Btm Flip

• convert each to an int in the range of -52 to +52 (no 0)
• If a string is not valid, your program must end.
• Your input must accept upper- or lower-case characters
